# Climate-Odyssey---Team-EnviroNauts
"Climate Odyssey," developed by Team EnviroNauts,using the Unity engine, designed to address the urgent global water crisis through education and engagement. This project harnesses Augmented Reality (AR) and machine learning (ML) to empower players to understand and combat water pollution. By integrating NASA satellite data and GLOBE protocols, players can conduct real-time water testing and analysis while exploring their environment through AR. As they gather data, players not only learn how to identify water quality issues but also develop and implement effective solutions to improve their local water conditions. The game includes an evaluation component that allows players to assess their understanding and memory of scientific principles, reinforcing their learning experience.
